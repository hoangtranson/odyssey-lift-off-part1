# Catstronauts - server

The starting point of the `server` code for Odyssey Lift-off I course.

```
npm install @apollo/server graphql graphql-tag
```

- The @apollo/server package provides a full-fledged, spec-compliant GraphQL server.
- The graphql package provides the core logic for parsing and validating GraphQL queries.
- The graphql-tag package provides the gql template literal that we'll use in a moment.
